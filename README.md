Python Practices

This repository contains small Python exercises, experiments, and study notes.
The goal is to practice core Python concepts while building familiarity with functions, modules, arguments (*args, **kwargs), file handling, simple scripts, and other fundamentals.

Each folder contains a group of small challenges or demonstrations related to a specific topic.

▶️ Running the Exercises

If you are using uv (recommended):

uv run <file>.py


Example:

uv run visually_explained/decorators/decorators_problem1.py


Or using Python directly:

python3 visually_explained/args_kwargs/args_kwargs_problem1.py

📚 Requirements

Most scripts run with standard Python 3 with no extra dependencies.
