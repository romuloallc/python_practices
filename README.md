Python Practices

This repository contains small Python exercises, experiments, and study notes.
The goal is to practice core Python concepts while building familiarity with functions, modules, arguments (*args, **kwargs), file handling, simple scripts, and other fundamentals.

Each folder contains a group of small challenges or demonstrations related to a specific topic.


▶️ Running the Exercises

If you are using uv (recommended):

`uv run <file>.py`


Example:

`uv run visually_explained/decorators/decorators_problem1.py`


Or using Python directly:

`python3 visually_explained/args_kwargs/args_kwargs_problem1.py`

📚 Requirements

Most scripts run with standard Python 3 with no extra dependencies.
